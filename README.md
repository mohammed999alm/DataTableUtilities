**Description**:
This repository provides a versatile and reusable method for creating `DataColumn` objects with customizable properties in C#. 
The `GenerateDataColumn` method allows developers to dynamically generate columns
 with specified attributes such as
  `AllowDBNull`, `ReadOnly`, `Unique`, `AutoIncrement`, `AutoIncrementSeed`, and `AutoIncrementStep`. 
  This toolkit simplifies and streamlines the process of working with `DataTable` structures,
   making it easier to handle tabular data dynamically.
